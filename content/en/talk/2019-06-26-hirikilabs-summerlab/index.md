SummerLab is a summer camp, a temporary cooperative meeting around topics related to various fields of technology, digital culture, open design and common learning, which brings together benchmark initiatives in these fields.

In its fourth edition, SummerLab proposes a programme that will tackle thematic meetings on data and citizen science during three moments of the summer with the participation of citizens, curious people, technological activists and people from the field of research. SummerLab is mainly a meeting space and its spirit is to share experiences and knowledge around diverse knowledge communities, which is why its operation as an intensive camp allows participants to cooperate, share and work together around the issues raised by the meeting or others linked to their interests or experiences.

In its first summer meeting SummerLab will work around data, citizen participation, privacy and transparency, analysing some of the perspectives that information and the massive treatment of data acquire in the present and doing so from different perspectives and spheres, such as academic, institutional or public-community. The meeting will combine two dynamics, an informative one that will translate into a public lecture with guests of reference projects in these fields and the other, practical or productive that will aim to produce some results through an intensive production workshop.

In its second meeting, in August, SummerLab will focus on astronomy, hosting the traditional annual meeting of citizen astronomy that will offer a series of workshops and observations of the firmament with the aim of bringing this science closer to citizens.

Finally, in September Summerlab 2019 will conclude with a meeting that will try to be a meeting point for citizen science in a broader sense with experiences that work in fields such as bio-hack labs, the environment, food or bioscience.
