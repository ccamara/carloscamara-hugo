In this seminar I will present two research projects that share a crowdsourced approach: [Accessible Zaragoza](https://www.carloscamara.es/en/project/zaccesible/) and [Post-Pandemic Equitable and Sustainable Transport](https://pest-project.org). Accessible Zaragoza is an action-research project of collaborative mapping about urban accessibility in the city of Zaragoza (Spain) I led while I was lecturing at the School of Architecture and Technology at San Jorge University. Accessible Zaragoza was aimed to create a collaborative online map that contributes to increase the autonomy of people with functional diversity and hence, their social integration and living standards. PEST Project is the project led by **Tim Jones** and **Ben Spencer** at [Oxford Brookes University](https://brookes.ac.uk) which aims to coproduce an indicators matrix to increase understanding of place-based policy and activity in relation to active travel in the aftermath of the Covid-19 pandemic.
