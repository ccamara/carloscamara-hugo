- Thank you for the invitation. I'm very honoured to be here today and I'm very happy that we are discussing this topic.
- I need to start stating that I feel uncomfortable with labelling me as an activist academic. It is not that I do not like the word activists. I think activism is needed now more than ever. It is not that I do not think that researchers are _Beings of Light_ whose hands cannot get dirty with such mundane matters.
- It is not that activism is inherently political,  and today, "political"  has lots of negative connotations, to the point that there are many voices claiming that academia should be a neutral space where politics do not fit, when, ironically, this is a very political  -and to me, problematic- move with veiled interests.
- On the contrary, as I will argue, I believe this is a combination that not only makes perfect sense, but also is needed more than ever.
- My discomfort comes from what I believe is an unfair comparison.
	- I have a lot of respect for activists. there are many currently giving their bodies to fight for climate change, for humanitarian organisations, against the rise of fascism and far-right, and what I do is miles away from this, not just in terms of achievements, but also the material conditions.
	  collapsed:: true
		- I do not have the courage that many activists have. e.g. I would never be able to embark in the summut flotilla.
		- I do not like stories about individual heroes.
	- To that matter, ==I am privileged person==. While academics are no longer part of an economical and powerful elite, and there is a lot of precariousness related to job insecurity, working conditions... We could also argue that the average academic is better positioned in terms of income and material conditions than the average activist.

		- While I acknowledge there is a lot of precariousness in academia, related to job insecurity, working conditions... Academics are still perceived as part of an intellectual elite and we could also argue that the average academic is better positioned in terms of income and material conditions than the average activist.
	- What I do is way more humble and less impactful:
		- I team up with activists to do research and produce impact.
- That said, I believe that I can share some experiences that I hope could be useful for anyone who is considering taking the path of academic activist. Specifically, I would want to speak about:
	- How I got in here
	- What's my understanding of being an academic activist
	- Why I think this matters
- ## How I started
	- Some researchers have a clear cause or topic such as universal basic income, or climate change, or feminism that articulates their research and activism. This is not me.
	- In my case, like almost everything in my career, was quite organic. It has more to do with being coherent with a particular way of understanding my place in the world and my areas of influence than a carefully designed strategy or following a call.
	- As someone from a working class background, I've always been sensitive to injustices and aware of social classes. This is probably something I inherited from my parents. But I've never been extremely politically involved, either -also influenced from my family, who suffered 40 years of dictatorship and saw in political involvement a source of conflicts.
	- An important turning point for me was when I was studying architecture university.
		- On the one hand, I was involved in several demonstration against cuts in HE.
		- As students of architecture we were expected to use specialised and very expensive software. Because university was not providing licences, and we could not afford buying them, it was assumed that we had to pirate the software we were using. I was not particularly comfortable and I started to be interested in the Free/Libre OpenSource movement that was getting attention on the 90 and from there I learnt about openculture and openscience movements.
	- It was 2010, and at that time, the world was also changing.
	- While I was Arab spring, indignados, occupy wall street ->
		- Demonstrated that alternative ways of organising society led by values such as equity, collaboration, care... were not only desirable but possible through collective action.
		- Put the focus in imagining and collectivelly building alternative societies, motivated by a different sets of values such as care, collective action
	- That's when I decided to start my Master's degree on participatory urbanism and then a PhD on urban commons, where I brought all of this together and I also met lots of grassroots initiatives that became my case studies. During this stage I was also working as a lecturer at the school of architecture and technology and I had the opportunity to led a project on accessibility and urban mobility where I collaborated with NGOs and grassroots about disabilities and OpenStreetMap.
	- When life had other plans for me and I move to the UK, I had to reorient my career and I started working in an area that I was also passionate: technology. And although the field may have changed, everything else has stayed the same, and I am now researching on the effects of design choices have in communities, particularly underrepresented or vulnerable communities.
	- This is the path that brought me where I am now, but also what has shaped my understanding of what being an activist researcher is.
- ## My understanding of activist researcher
	- I'm usually motivated to research around topics with a societal impact. These tend to be related to how physical and digital infrastructures shape certain aspects of society, and how they are also shaped by certain parts of the society.
	- Because of that, I reach out to communities involved in the topic, usually communities involved in the production of those devices.
	- I apply participative methods to
		- incorporate the experiences and expertises to the research
		- understand their needs and challenges
		-
	- This requires a lot of listening, understanding... but also negotiating and acknowledging that our paths sometimes go hand to hand, some times will diverge.
	- for me,
		- researchers are facilitators for social change
		- impact is not a by-product of research. Instead, research is the means I've found to produce impact while giving me the intellectual stimulation and methodological rigour that I need.
	- I'm aware this is not the only way of understanding what being an activist researcher or researcher activist is, probably not the best or more efficient way of doing it. But it give meaning to what I do, and when it works it gives me a sense of accomplishment and peace of mind like that I think it is worth pursuing.
- **Why I think this matters**
	- And far from egoistic reasons, I think this is a a great opportunity for researchers to leave our ivory tower and leverage our privileged position to help causes that matter to use by:
		- reaching people that may not be accessible to activists
		- getting funds and bringing attention
		- advancing with theory, or methodologically sound approaches
-
-
- I'm happy that Impact is recognised in Research, and contributes to career  promotion. So researchers do not have to choose between research and activism because they can even be the same thing!
-
- Tensions
	- Activism is collective, and research tends to be about individuals.
