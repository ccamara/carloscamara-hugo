Master in Computerization of Architectural Projects at the Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya (2004) and Master in Information and Knowledge Society at the Universitat Oberta de Catalunya (2012).<span id="dots">...</span><div id="more">

My multi-disciplinary training and **my multiple research interests are structured around the comodifications between city, technology and society within the framework of informationalism and free culture**, aspects that I approach both from my academic professional side and from my activist side.

I am currently a researcher associate at [Urban Transformations and Global Change (TURBA)](https://www.uoc.edu/portal/en/in3/recerca/grups/urban_transformation_and) of the Universitat Oberta de Catalunya and I am currently on a leave from [Universidad San Jorge](https://usj.es), where I have been working from 2009-2019 as a Lecturer at the School of Architecture and Technology, teaching Digital Tools, Open Classroom and Urbanism I and researching at the OpenSource Architectures research group. Since the academic year 2015-2016 until 2019 I led the action-research project [Zaragoza Accesible](https://zaccesible.usj.es), which has aroused acceptance and interest among members of local collectives and the disability sector as well as in the press and has recently been awarded with the [García Mercadal accessit](/blog/2017/10/02/zaragoza-accesible-accesit-premio-garcia-mercadal/), awarded by the Colegio de Arquitectos de Aragón, in the category of removal of architectural barriers.

I have been a guest lecturer in the subject "Digital Fabrication" at the [School of Artehicture at the Limerick Univeristy](http://saul.ie/) (2013), in the summer course Arquiredes organized in 2010 by the University of Granada and in the Vertical Workshop 2009 directed by Emilio Tuñón and Luís M. Mansilla in the International University of Catalonia (UIC) in 2009 directed by Emilio Tuñón and Luís M. Mansilla in the International University of Catalonia.

Complementary, I am also a reviewer in several journals, such as [The International Journal of the Commons](https://www.thecommonsjournal.org/) (International Association for the Study of the Commons), [Eure, Revista Latinoamericana de Estudios Urbanos Regionales](http://eure.cl/index.php), [Revista de Arquitectura](https://editorial.ucatolica.edu.co/ojsucatolica/revistas_ucatolica/index.php/RevArq) (Catholic University of Chile) or [URBS: journal of urban studies and social sciences](http://www2.ual.es/urbs/index.php/urbs/index) (Universidad de Almería), where I recently (March 2018) joined the editorial team.

On my activist side, I cintribute to open and alternative projects and initiatives such as [OpenStreetMap](https://openstreetmap.org), [QGIS](https://qgis.es), [Cadáveres Inmobiliarios](http://cadaveresinmobiliarios.org/), [Drupal](http://drupal.org) or [Mapeado Colaborativo](https://mapcolabora.org), the action-research group I founded with Miguel Sevilla-Callejo in 2016 to promote the tools and knowledge to make open and alternative cartographies.

Additionally, I have also worked as a web developer and I have exploited my side as a divulgator as a member of the team of the [XI edition of the Spanish Biennial of Architecture and Urbanism (2011)](/project/web-beauxi/) organized by the Consejo Superior de Colegios de Arquitectos de España, curating the travelling exhibition "[Materia Sensible, jóvenes arquitectos catalanes](http://materiasensible.cat)", together with Joan Vitòria and Pere Buil (2010-2012), the exhibition "44 Young European Architects", together with Félix Arranz, as well as in the architecture documentary agency Scalae (2007-2009) and the direction of the magazine Arquitectura Plus during the years 2008 and 2009.

In 2004 I created [+arquitectura](/project/plusarquitectura/), an architecture portal that I kept open until 2010 and that introduced me to the world of programming and free software and was one of the works selected for the 2008 Arquia/Proxima prize awarded by the Caja de Arquitectos Foundation. Years later (2009) I started my second journey in the world of digital entrepreneurship: [ArchTLAS](/project/archtlas/), a collaborative and online atlas of architecture. In 2006 I created my personal blog and, after several radical transformations such as the one you are reading, I keep it updated relatively frequently today at this same URL.</div>
