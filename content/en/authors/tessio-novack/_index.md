Our observation and representations of the world are not objective. Instead, they are dependent on our perception capabilities, cultural context, and social biases. Aligned with this epistemological (and critical) stance, I am interested in theoretical and practical approaches for extracting and representing culture-bound spatial knowledges and conceptualizations of space. More specifically, I am interested in ways emerging digital data, computational methods, and Geographic Information Systems can be combined for representing alternative perceptions of the urban space and, ultimately, for advancing constructive social changes.
