I am a versatile, transdisciplinary and passionate person with a mixed technical and sociological background: I’ve worked as an architect, drupal developer, project manager, lecturer, researcher and as a data scientist, doing data munging and visualization using R and dealing with geospatial data using QGIS.

My multiple research interests are framed within the Urban Studies, and more specifically around the commodifications between cities, technology and society. So far, I have focused on the topic of social and spatial inequities to find ways in which cities can be more sustainable and egalitarian, hence improving people’s well-being.
