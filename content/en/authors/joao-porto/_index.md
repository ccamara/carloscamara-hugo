His research adopts a transdisciplinary approach to digital geographies and geographic information science, intersecting urban data science, information management and development studies. His transdisciplinary research on socio-ecological-technical urban systems not only emphasises cross-border collaboration between the (environmental) sciences, social sciences and humanities; it also goes beyond academic disciplines to engage in co-production and participatory research with non-academic stakeholders.
