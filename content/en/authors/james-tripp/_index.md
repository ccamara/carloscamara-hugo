My background combines both research and technology. I am an experimental Psychologist by training (BSc, PhD) working in cognitive modelling(BSc), applied cognitive science(PhD) and specifically information integration (Post-doc). I have designed and built experiments, and carried out various data analysis (from frequentist statistics to non-linear and Bayesian modelling) and led labs on computational methods in Psychology. Previously, I worked as a Senior Academic Technology at the Centre for Interdisciplinary Methodologies where I built out a Linux research infrastructure, wrote research software crossing multiple domains and both designed and delivered a diverse range of labs within multiple disciplines including data visualisation, data science, digital methods, geospatial analysis, machine learning and software engineering.
