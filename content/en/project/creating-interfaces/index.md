An open source prototype for a visual interface to support research and Nexus engagements, designed collaborativelly as part of [Creating interfaces'](https://creatinginterfaces.eifer.kit.edu/) WP4, developed by the [Institute for Global Sustainable Development](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/arts/schoolforcross-facultystudies/igsd) at the [University of Warwick](https://warwick.ac.uk/).

## Aim

The aim of this tool is to provide an interface capable of understanding the implications of our decisions regarding food, and how can meals in kindergartens be turned into drivers for positive change for the health and the environment.

The visualisation tool may be helpful to perform tasks such as:

* Identify highly rated meals and the lower rated meals
* Identify meals with higher footprint
* Identify ingredients with higher footprint

Which, ultimately, will lead to discussions and reflections on how food, energy and water are interlinked and how small changes in food can make a big impact.

## Online demos

* Food in Kindergartens, Slupsk (Poland): [Dashboard](https://igsd-uow.github.io/wfenexus_demo/slupsk/slupsk_dashboard.html#overview)
* Food waste, Wilmington (USA): [Scrollytelling](https://igsd-uow.github.io/wfenexus_demo/wilmington/infographics.html)
* Local producers, Tulcea (Romania): [Interactive map](https://igsd-uow.github.io/wfenexus_demo/tulcea/tulcea_dashboard.html)
