# Abstract.
abstract = "Assuming  that  social  psychology  is  directly,  intrinsically,  totally  and  fundamentally  political  (Ibáñez,  1983),  in  this  text  we  make  a  brief  reflection  in  relation  to  the  political  and  ethical  character  of  the  work  in  social  psychology.  In  a first section we tackle why is it important to consider the political and the ethical aspects in our discipline. Then, in the second section, we develop some elements that we can use, as social psychologists both in the field of research and intervention:  reflexivity  and  problematisation;  the  issue  of  expert knowledge; accessibility, commitment, craftmanship or  learning.  Finally,  in  the  third  section,  we  present  some  conclusions  about  the  interrelation  between  those  topics,  their application and some of their possible limitations."
