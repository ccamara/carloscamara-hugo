# Abstract.
abstract = """An open source prototype for a visual interface to support research and Food-Water-Energy Nexus engagements, designed collaborativelly as part of Creating interfacesâ€™ WP4, developed by the Institute for Global Sustainable Development at the University of Warwick, and aimed to identify and visualise a grounded nexus for three different study cases: Kindergartens in Slupsk (Poland), food waste in Wilmington (USA) and local producers in Tulcea (Romania). 

The expectation of this tool is to provide an interface to increase the understanding of how food, energy and water are interlinked in a specific context and, ultimately, to inform and support decision-making aimed to produce changes in behaviours that have positive impacts in terms of Food, Energy and Water."""
